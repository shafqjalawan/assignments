    <p>To blame Suu for being locked up for so many years is perverse, like blaming
        Joan of Arc for being burned at the stake. Yet it is true that her imprisonment has
        in a sense been voluntary, and this is one of the things that explains her enduring
        and almost universal popularity with ordinary Burmese people. Myanmar's ruling National
        League for Democracy (NLD) party has secured enough seats in parliament to form the next government,
        according
        to the latest election results.
        The NLD has so far won 346 seats, more than the 322 seats needed to form the next government.</p>

        <p>It is this decision—a moral much more than a political decision, and one from
            which she has not deviated in more than twenty years, despite every attempt to
            blackmail her emotionally—which has earned her an unwavering place in the
            hearts of tens of millions of Burmese. She could have flown away, and she never
            did. That has created an unbreakable bond, Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi waves from the

            <p>Aung San Suu Kyi was born on June 19, 1945, in the Irrawaddy Delta, the
                third of three children, during the most tumultuous years in Burma's history. Her
                father, Aung San, was at the heart of the tumult. Rangoon, the capital, had just
                fallen to the Allies, and her pregnant mother had sought refuge from the fighting
                in the countryside, Myanmar long known as Burma, has been notorious for its repressive
                rule, though there have been signs of reform in recent months,
                such as the easing of media censorship and changes in labor and elections laws.</p>

                <p>Aung San was a boy from the provinces, shy, a poor speaker, with abrupt
                    manners, and prone to long unexplained silences.
                    5 Short and wiry, with the sort
                    of blankness of expression that leads Westerners to describe people from the
                    East as inscrutable, he also had something special about him, a charisma. With a
                    fiery temper and an iron will, he emerged at Rangoon University in the 1930s as
                    one of the most ambitious and determined of the students dedicated to freeing
                    Burma from the British.</p>

                <p>But in 1885 the British finished the job, storming Mandalay, the last seat of
                    the kings, sacking the palace, burning much of the ancient library and sending
                    King Thibaw and his queen Supayalat into exile in western India. They brought
                    the whole kingdom into the Indian system, governing it from the Viceroy's
                    palace in Calcutta, and supplementing or replacing the local rulers who had been
                    the king's allies with British administrators. </p>

                <p>But by the time Burma had been subdued, the Indians across the border were
                    themselves becoming restless. The Indian National Congress had been founded
                    in 1885, the year the Burmese monarchy was abolished, and rapidly became the
                    focus for Indian hopes of self-government. The First World War weakened the
                    empire dramatically. The arrival of Mohandas Gandhi from South Africa gave
                    Congress a leader of unique charisma and creativity, and the massacre at
                    Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar in 1919 brought home the fact that British rule was
                    a confidence trick..</p>
